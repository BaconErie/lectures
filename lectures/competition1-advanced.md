# Quick Notes

- These competitions DO matter! Over the course of the year we'll build these up to give you a full resume. We will also be factoring effort into officer applications (so don't slack off!).
- You can ONLY use HTML and CSS (Tailwind is fine but it must be via inline script)
- If you want, you can submit your site to [Boba](https://boba.hackclub.com/) to get a free $5 (but you must follow their requirements first)
